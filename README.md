# StochMan - Stochastic Manifolds made easier

StochMan (Stochastic Manifolds) is a collection of elementary algorithms for computations 
on random manifolds learned from finite noisy data. Each algorithm assume that the considered 
manifold model implement a specific set of interfaces.

## Installation

For the latest release
```bash
pip install stochman
```
For master version with most recent changes we recommend:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MachineLearningLifeScience/stochman
cd stochman
python setup.py install
```

## API overview

`StochMan` includes a number of modules that each defines a set of functionalities for
working with manifold data.

### `stochman.nnj`: `torch.nn` with jacobians

Key to working with Riemannian geometry is the ability to compute jacobians. The jacobian matrix
contains the first order partial derivatives. `stochman.nnj` provides plug-in replacements for the many 
used `torch.nn` layers such as `Linear`, `BatchNorm1d` etc. and commonly used activation functions such as `ReLU`,
`Sigmoid` etc. that enables fast computations of jacobians between the input to the layer and the output. 

``` python
import torch
from stochman import nnj

model = nnj.Sequential(nnj.Linear(10, 5),
                       nnj.ReLU())
x = torch.randn(100, 10)
y, J = model(x, jacobian=True)
print(y.shape) # output from model: torch.size([100, 5])
print(J.shape) # jacobian between input and output: torch.size([100, 5, 10])
```

### `stochman.manifold`: Interface for working with Riemannian manifolds

A manifold can be constructed simply by specifying its metric. The example below shows a toy example where the metric grows with the distance to the origin.

``` python
import torch
from stochman.manifold import Manifold

class MyManifold(Manifold):
    def metric(self, c, return_deriv=False):
        N, D = c.shape  # N is number of points where we evaluate the metric; D is the manifold dimension
        sq_dist_to_origin = torch.sum(c**2, dim=1, keepdim=True)  # Nx1
        G = (1 + sq_dist_to_origin).unsqueeze(-1) * torch.eye(D).repeat(N, 1, 1)  # NxDxD
        return G
        
model = MyManifold()
p0, p1 = torch.randn(1, 2), torch.randn(1, 2)
c, _ = model.connecting_geodesic(p0, p1)  # geodesic between two random points
```

If you manifold is embedded (e.g. an autoencoder) then you only have to provide a function for realizing the embedding (i.e. a decoder) and StochMan takes care of the rest (you, however, have to learn the autoencoder yourself).

``` python
import torch
from stochman.manifold import EmbeddedManifold

class Autoencoder(EmbeddedManifold):
    def embed(self, c, jacobian = False):
        return self.decode(c)
        
model = Autoencoder()
p0, p1 = torch.randn(1, 2), torch.randn(1, 2)
c, _ = model.connecting_geodesic(p0, p1)  # geodesic between two random points
```

### `stochman.geodesic`: computing geodesics made easy!

Geodesics are energy-minimizing curves, and StochMan computes them as such. You can use the high-level `Manifold` interface or the more explicit one:

``` python
import torch
from stochman.geodesic import geodesic_minimizing_energy
from stochman.curves import CubicSpline

model = MyManifold()
p0, p1 = torch.randn(1, 2), torch.randn(1, 2)
curve = CubicSpline(p0, p1)
geodesic_minimizing_energy(curve, model)
```

### `stochman.curves`: Simple curve objects

We often want to manipulate curves when computing geodesics. StochMan provides an implementation of cubic splines and discrete curves, both with the end-points fixed.

``` python
import torch
from stochman.curves import CubicSpline

p0, p1 = torch.randn(1, 2), torch.randn(1, 2)
curve = CubicSpline(p0, p1)

t = torch.linspace(0, 1, 50)
ct = curve(t)  # 50x2
```
